## Introduction to Indicator
Phytoplankton are the foundation of the marine food web and are the primary food source for zooplankton and filter feeders such as shellfish. Numerous environmental and oceanographic factors interact to drive the abundance, composition, spatial distribution, and productivity of phytoplankton. Satellite derived measurements of chlorophyll, the dominant photosynthetic pigment in phytoplankton, are used to estimate phytoplankton biomass. Phytoplankton growth depends on the availability of carbon dioxide, sunlight and nutrients and their growth rates can be influenced by water temperature, water depth, wind, and grazing pressure.  Primary productivity is a measure of the amount of carbon produced by phytoplankton. The seasonal cycle of phytoplankton size distribution are typically dominated by larger-celled microplankton during the winter-spring and fall bloom periods, while smaller-celled nanoplankton dominate during the warmer summer months.
